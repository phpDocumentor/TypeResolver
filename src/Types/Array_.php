 * Represents an array type as described in the PSR-5, the PHPDoc Standard.

 * An array can be represented in two forms:
 *
 * 1. Untyped (`array`), where the key and value type is unknown and hence classified as 'Mixed_'.
 * 2. Types (`string[]`), where the value type is provided by preceding an opening and closing square bracket with a
 *    type name.
